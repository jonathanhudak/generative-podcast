Create a detailed and engaging script for a solo podcast episode exploring the fascinating intersection of mathematics and origami. The script should cover the following aspects:

1. Introduction to the ancient art of origami and its evolution into a mathematical discipline
2. Explanation of key mathematical concepts in origami, such as the Huzita-Hatori axioms
3. Discussion of how origami has led to breakthroughs in fields like engineering and architecture
4. Exploration of specific origami applications in mathematics, such as solving cubic equations
5. Examination of notable mathematicians and their contributions to origami theory
6. Analysis of the computational complexity of origami folding sequences
7. Overview of how origami principles are used in space technology and solar panel design
8. Explanation of tessellations and their relationship to origami
9. Discussion of modular origami and its connection to polyhedra and symmetry
10. Exploration of origami's role in education and its potential to enhance spatial reasoning skills
11. Concluding thoughts on the future of mathematical origami and its potential impact on various fields

The script should present complex concepts in an accessible manner, using analogies and real-world examples where appropriate. Include personal anecdotes or experiences related to origami or mathematics to add a human touch to the episode.
