Generate a compelling and informative script for a solo podcast episode about unsolved mathematical problems with million-dollar prizes. The script should cover the following aspects:

1. An introduction to the concept of unsolved mathematical problems and their significance in the field of mathematics.

2. A brief history of the Millennium Prize Problems, established by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.

3. Detailed explanations of at least three specific unsolved problems with million-dollar prizes, such as the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP Problem, and the Navier-Stokes Equation.

4. The potential real-world applications and implications of solving these problems.

5. Notable attempts and progress made towards solving these problems.

6. The impact of these prizes on the mathematical community and public interest in mathematics.

7. Other famous unsolved problems in mathematics that don't have monetary prizes attached.

8. The controversy and debate surrounding the use of financial incentives in mathematical research.

9. Personal anecdotes or insights from mathematicians working on these problems.

10. A conclusion that reflects on the importance of continued research in mathematics and the excitement of the unknown in this field.

The script should be engaging, accessible to a general audience, and maintain a balance between technical explanations and relatable examples. Include occasional humor and thought-provoking questions to keep listeners engaged throughout the episode.
