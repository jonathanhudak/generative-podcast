Create a compelling and informative script for a solo podcast episode exploring the fascinating intersection of psychology and physics in time perception. The script should delve into how our brains process and interpret the passage of time, as well as the scientific theories that explain the nature of time itself. Include discussions on:

1. The subjective experience of time and how it can vary based on emotions, age, and mental states.
2. The role of the brain's internal clock and neurotransmitters in time perception.
3. Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications for time dilation.
4. The concept of "time flies when you're having fun" and why boring experiences seem to drag on.
5. How different cultures perceive and relate to time.
6. The phenomenon of time speeding up as we age and potential explanations for this effect.
7. The impact of technology and modern life on our perception of time.
8. Experiments and studies that have shed light on time perception, such as the "oddball effect."
9. The philosophical implications of time perception and its relation to consciousness.
10. Practical tips for listeners to improve their time management based on psychological insights.

Ensure the script maintains a balance between scientific accuracy and accessibility for a general audience, using relatable examples and analogies to illustrate complex concepts.
