Create a compelling and informative script for a solo podcast episode exploring the potential of edible insects as a future food source. The script should cover the nutritional benefits of consuming insects, their environmental sustainability compared to traditional livestock, and cultural barriers to widespread adoption in Western countries. Include specific examples of popular edible insects, such as crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers, and discuss current culinary applications and products incorporating insect protein. Address common concerns and misconceptions about eating insects, and explore the role of insect farming in addressing global food security challenges. Conclude with a balanced perspective on the future of edible insects in the global food system and potential steps listeners can take to learn more or even try insect-based foods themselves.
